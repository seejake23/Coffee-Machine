# Coffee-Machine

This project was from Dr. Angela Yu's course "100 Days of code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp fro 2023" on Udemy. 

I started programming in November 2022, starting with Python. Once I passed my ITS Python course I moved to SQL and then Java, currently on HTML5/CSS/JavaScript.
I realized I did not have very in-depth projects for python so I decide to start Dr. Yu's course to further hone my skills and so I could grow my GitHub profile.

This project incorperates everything nested dictionaries, functions, scope. It also illustrates how even a simple coffee machine, involves well thought planning and more code than you might realize.

Once you run the code, it will ask the user to pick a type of coffee. Assuming first, the machine still has enough resources, and the user has inserted enough money -- the coffee will dispense, and the ingredients will be lessened based off the coffee chosen. If there is not enough resources, the money will be refunded. 

When asked for the type of coffee, you can also say "off" (ending the program) as well as "report" which will print the amount fo resources left.
